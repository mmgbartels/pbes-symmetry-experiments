# Overview

Note that the GUI tools are a completely separate workspace, because it's not
(yet) possible to conditionally enable workspace members based on features or
any other means. The gui tools depend on large GUI frameworks, in our case
Slint, that is undesirable to have by default as it adds roughtly 600
dependencies. Compiling the GUI tools on Ubuntu requires both `libfreetype-dev`
and `libfontconfig1-dev` to be installed.

# Contributing

It is also convenient to open this directory directly in `vscode` since opening
the root directory makes it not work within this workspace.
