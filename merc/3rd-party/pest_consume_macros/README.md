# Overview

 > ⚠️ **important** This is an internal crate and is not intended for public use.

This is a vendored version of the `pest_consume_macros` crate, used by the `MERC`
toolset, since the original crate is not actively maintained. This version
has been stripped of all features that are not used by us and we only intend to
update its dependencies and fix any issues that arise from using it in our toolset.

See the original crate for a full description.
