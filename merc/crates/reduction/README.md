# Overview

This crate provides various algorithms for reducing labeled transition systems
(LTS) modulo various equivalence relations, see `merc_lts`. These algorithms can
also be used to compare LTS for equivalence. For now the equivalences that are
supported are strong bisimulation, branching bisimulation, and weak
bisimulation.

## Usage

The main functionalities of this crate of provided by the `reduce_lts` and
`compare_lts` functions, which can be used to reduce and compare LTS using all
available equivalence relations. These functions, and many functions in this crate,
accept the inputs by value, since these reductions often need to preprocess the given
LTS (.e.g,)

```rust
use merc_lts::LTS;
use merc_lts::read_aut;
use merc_reduction::reduce_lts;
use merc_reduction::Equivalence;
use merc_utilities::Timing;

let lts = read_aut(b"des(0, 6, 7)
(0, a, 1)
(0, a, 2)
(1, b, 3)
(1, c, 4)
(2, b, 5)
(2, c, 6)
" as &[u8], Vec::new()).unwrap();

let mut timings = Timing::new();
assert_eq!(lts.num_of_states(), 7); // The original has 7 states
let reduced = reduce_lts(lts, Equivalence::StrongBisim, &mut timings);
assert_eq!(reduced.num_of_states(), 3);
```

## Changelog

### Current

Added the `clap` feature to conditionally enable the `clap` dependency to derive
some convenience traits.

## Authors

This crate was developed by Maurice Laveaux and Jan J. Martens. The main
signature based branching bisimulation algorithm is described in the paper:

> "Faster Signature Refinement for Branching Bisimilarity Minimization". Maurice Laveaux and Jan J. Martens. TACAS 2026.

## Safety

This crate contains minimal `unsafe` code, but modules that don't use `unsafe` code
are clearly marked as such.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

We do not maintain an official minimum supported rust version (MSRV), and it may be upgraded at any time when necessary.
