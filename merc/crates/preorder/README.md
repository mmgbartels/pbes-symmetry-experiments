# Overview

This crate provides algorithms to check various preorder relations between labelled transition systems (LTSs). The main functionality is checking whether an implementation LTS is refined by a specification LTS with respect to the failures-divergence preorder, which the preorder widely used by the [FDR4](https://cocotec.io/fdr/); the CSP refinement checker.

```rust
use merc_lts::read_aut;
use merc_utilities::Timing;

use merc_preorder::refines;
use merc_preorder::RefinementType;

let impl_lts = read_aut(b"des (0,8,6)                                        
(0,newday,1)
(1,tau,2)
(1,tau,3)
(2,teach,4)
(3,lindyhop,0)
(3,tau,5)
(4,newday,2)
(5,teach,0)
" as &[u8], Vec::new()).unwrap();

let spec_lts = read_aut(b"des (0,5,4)                                        
(0,newday,1)
(1,tau,2)
(1,tau,3)
(2,teach,0)
(3,lindyhop,0)
" as &[u8], Vec::new()).unwrap();

// Note that this is trace refinement, not weak trace.
let result = refines(impl_lts, spec_lts, RefinementType::Trace, &mut Timing::new());
assert!(!result);
```

## Changelog

### Current

Added the `clap` feature to conditionally enable the `clap` dependency to derive
some convenience traits.

## Related Work

The original implementation as part of the mCRL2 toolset was done by Jan Friso
Groote, and this has been adapted to Rust by Maurice Laveaux. The
failure-divergences refinement algorithms are based on the following article:

And the impossible futures algorithm is based on:
