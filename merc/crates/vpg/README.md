# Overview

This crate provides functionality for working with variability parity games.
This includes reading and writing for parity games in the
[PGSolver](https://github.com/tcsprojects/pgsolver) `.pg` format. For
variability parity games this format is extended with feature configurations
encoded as BDDs on the edges, with a corresponding `.vpg` format. These games
can be solved using Zielonka's recursive algorithm, displayed in
[Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) `DOT` format and generated from modal
mu-calculus formulas.

A central `PG` or parity game trait is used to allow writing generic algoritms
for parity games. Various helpers are introduced for working with `strong` types
for priorities, explicitly representing the even and odd players etc. This crate
uses [OxiDD](https://oxidd.net/) for the binary decision diagrams.

## Usage

Reading a `.pg` from disk and subsequently solving it can simply be done as
follows.

```rust
use merc_vpg::read_pg;
use merc_vpg::solve_zielonka;

let parity_game = read_pg(b"parity 3;
0 0 0 1;
1 0 0 2;
2 1 0 2;
" as &[u8]).unwrap();

// Solve the game, produces a full solution for all vertices.
let solution = solve_zielonka(&parity_game);
```

## Changelog

### Current

Added the `clap` feature to conditionally enable the `clap` dependency to derive
some convenience traits.

## Authors

The implementation of this crate was developed by Sjef van Loo and Maurice
Laveaux. The theoretical foundations were laid by Maurice Ter Beek, Erik de Vink
and Tim A.C. Willemse, in the following publication:
